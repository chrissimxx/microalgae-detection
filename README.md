# Microalgae detection
Many biology and medical procedures involve counting cells from images taken with a microscope. Counting cells reveals the concentration of bacteria and viruses and gives vital information on the progress of a disease. To accomplish the counting, researchers painstakingly count the cells by hand with the assistance of a device called hemocytometer. This process is repetitive, tedious, and prone to errors. What if we could automate the counting by using an intelligent deep learning algorithm instead? Using the detecto library, a microalgae detection system is made. Pictures of microalgae are inserted into the system and the model will then detect how many microalgae are there for each picture.
